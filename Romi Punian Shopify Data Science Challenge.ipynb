    "\n",
    "On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It appears there is a few abnormally large orders that have significantly larger order amounts\n",
    "\n",
    "- One such example is order ID 16 which is for 2000 sneakers by user ID 607, for and order amount of $704000. It appears user 607 is likely a reseller who buys sneakers in bulk and sells them later at a higher prices as they have multiple large orders. Outliers such as this are probably skewing the AOV if we were to take a mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are also orders (such as order ID 161, or 512 for example) with smaller total items ordered that still have large values for their order amounts so these should possibly be investigated further as these are also affecting the average order value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What metric would you report for this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "- I believe looking for the median of the order amount would be a better metric to look at. First we will have to organize the data by order amount in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is its value?\n",
